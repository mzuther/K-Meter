v1.12 (2010-06-15, initial commit)
==================================

* K-20/RMS, K-14/RMS and K-12/RMS meters (plus normal meter for
  channel strips)

  infinite peak and average hold, overflow counter, reset button

* GNU/Linux: VST plug-in, stand-alone (ALSA, Jack) Windows: VST
  plug-in

* still missing: band-limitation of average meter, validation of
  read-out
