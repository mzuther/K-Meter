## FAQ

### K-Meter crashes when the plug-in is loaded/opened

K-Meter comes with a folder called `kmeter`.  This folder must be
located in the same folder as the plug-in, so please copy it along and
try again!

For documentation and further information, please see the [manual][]
and the directory [doc][].
